=====================

### Normal priority
* Write scene class
* Implement entity drawing
* Implement texture loading (maybe SOIL or devIL?)

### Low priority
* Test audio API
* Work around existing shader deletion (one at a time)
* Allow variety of timer precisions to work with FPS delays

### In Progress
* Plan rendering architecture
* Write texture wrapper / loader

### Complete
* Logging system
* Subsystem architecture
* Math functions
* 3D Vector
* .ini file parser
* Asset manager
* WAV sound playing
* Audio manager
* Settings module
* Write high-speed stack memory allocator
* Re-write all uses of logging to use singleton access
* Shader wrapper class
* Write VAO Wrapper
* Implement primitive drawing basics
* Test shader/effect wrappers
* Update to GLFW 3
* Implement quad drawing
* Write lighting wrapper
